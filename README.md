# 3DExtra
A project for AR/VR Hackathon

The Goal of 3DExtra is to make education more accessible to students.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
One of the sustainable development goals is QUALITY EDUCATION which  to â€œensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
There is, however, a huge gap in the education system in Rural and Urban Areas in Nigeria. In rural area, most secondary schools either have no laboratory, or lacks the neccessary apparatus that could make experiments easier for the students.


CURRENT SOLUTION
Most solutions that are available are currently targeting the virtual reality headset for more immersive experience. As much as this solution feels immersive, it does not address the challenges facing the education sectors in the rural area, because:
1. The schools would not be able to afford the Headset since they could not afford the apparatus
2. The parents would not be able to afford the Headset since they could not afford to send their kids to a better schools.


WHY IS OUR SOLUTION BETTER?
Our solution, MRLAB, is leveraging on what the students, teachers, and parents already have - Mobile Phones.
Most students have access to phones which is already an advantage. The MRLAB would give students the opportunity to :
1. Have a first hand experience on what a science laboratory looks like
2. Interact with quality laboratory apparatus
3. Perform different Chemical Experiments

....all these without extra cost.


WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED ON?
Due to the limited time, We could not implement diffeernt experiments. However, the interactions provided is a proof that the mixed reality technology will give learners the ability to perform any kind of experiment at any point in time with their mobile phones.
In future update, we would be adding:
1. Series of Experiments regarding Titration
2. Separation Techniques
3. ..and Physics practicals.
